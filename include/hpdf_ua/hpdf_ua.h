/*
 * hpdf_ua.h -- PDF/UA-1 (ISO 14289-1) tagging extensions for libharu.
 *
 * This header is this project's own addition, not part of upstream libharu
 * (see NOTICE.md). It sits on top of libharu's public API (hpdf.h) and adds
 * no dependency on any application beyond libharu itself -- in particular,
 * nothing here depends on Migrate-n or any of its internals.
 *
 * Status conventions used throughout this header (see docs/roadmap.md for
 * the milestone each item belongs to):
 *   - Functions marked REAL are implemented now and safe to call.
 *   - Functions marked STUB return HPDF_UA_NOT_YET_IMPLEMENTED and otherwise
 *     do nothing -- they exist so the intended API surface is fixed early
 *     and callers get an explicit, loud failure instead of silently
 *     shipping untagged output.

 * NoView flag not set unless the annotation itself is an Artifact") that
 * none of libharu's own annotation constructors set by default. Call

 * exist (order between creating the two doesn't matter). `elem`'s /Pg
 * need not already be set -- an OBJR-only element (a Link whose only

 * `elem` has one -- a genuinely separate PDF/UA-1 requirement from the
 * structure-tree association above: ISO 14289-1:2014 7.18.5 requires
 * link annotations specifically to carry their own alternate
 * description via /Contents (PDF 32000-1 14.9.3), which a /Alt on the
 * *structure element* does not by itself satisfy -- confirmed by a real
 * veraPDF run while porting this project's own annotation demo (clause
 * 7.18.5, "Links shall contain an alternate description via their
 * Contents key"). Call HPDF_UA_SetAlternateText() on `elem` before this
 * function if you want that text reused as /Contents automatically; if
 * `elem` has no /Alt set, no /Contents is added and the caller is
 * responsible for satisfying 7.18.5 another way (e.g. an /Contents it
